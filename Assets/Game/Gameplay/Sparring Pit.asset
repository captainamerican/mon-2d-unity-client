  Name: Sparring Pit
  Information: "The pit features a mannequin fashioned by a necromancer who loved
    sparring. I can install spare body parts and with a little magic, the parts gain
    experience without direct manipulation. \n\nIt doesn't happen automatically.
    But when I come back after a few battles of my own, I can feel extra energy radiating
    from installed body parts.\n\nThe mannequin is <i>missing pieces</i>. I remember
    hearing how the creator liked to drag the mannequin around the islands. So maybe
    I'll come across them one day."
