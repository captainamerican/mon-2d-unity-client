  Information: "I could attach a head to the hip socket of a creature's torso, but
    it wouldn't be very useful. \n\nSkills and Appendages are assigned a variety
    of <i>tags</i> to help categorize them. Aligning the tags on the skills with
    the tags on the relevant body parts will boost the skill's effectiveness.\n\nI
    have been able to create new side effects like status ailments by combining certain
    body part tags with certain skill tags."
