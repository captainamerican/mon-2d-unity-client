  Information: "As a body part's experience increases, it reaches thresholds known
    as \u201Cgrades\u201D. Broadly speaking, there are three grades. For all body
    parts, the higher the grade, the closer the body part is to its living capabilities.\n\nThe
    head body part is special: I can equip more skills into one as the grade grows."
