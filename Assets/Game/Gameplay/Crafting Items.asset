  Information: "Few ever come to the islands. And I haven't seen another necromancer
    in... a long time. I've had to learn how to cook my own food and craft basic
    items like potions. \n\nSadly, I don't have all the <i>equipment</i> necessary
    to craft some of the more complicated items. But I've regained enough of myself
    to start venturing deeper into the islands. Hopefully I'll come across what I
    need before too long."
