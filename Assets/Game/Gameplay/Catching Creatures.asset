  Information: 'I''m a necromancer, not a zookeeper. I build creatures from the <i>remains</i>
    of my defeated foes.


    Splashing <i>Preservative</i> on a creature during
    combat will cause the essense of the soul to linger after defeat. Allowing me
    to extract a body part to use in <i>constructing a creature</i>. Each battle
    is different, so I''m never sure which body part is usable until all''s said
    and done.


    The higher quality the <i>Preservative</i>, the better quality
    of the resulting body part. Or, to put another way, the more damage a creature
    can sustain before having to apply more.'
