  Information: "Notes left behind in the Sparring Pit mention \u201Cenhancers\u201D
    which can be crafted. These increase the amount of experience earned by body
    parts, but their quality will degrade over time.\n\nWhen a body part's quality
    drops to zero, they will gain minimal experience from the Sparring Pit."
