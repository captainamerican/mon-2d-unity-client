  Information: 'The torso of a creature determines how many appendages a creature
    will have. From none to six. The fun is in figuring out a nice combination!


    Appendages
    are generally speaking interchangeable. Some skills perform better with certain
    <i>Essense Tags</i> on certain appendages. For instance, skills like <i>Scratch</i>
    works well with appendages that have the <i>Claw</i> tag. <i>Kick</i> does more
    damage if a rear appendage has the <i>Leg</i> tag.


    Synergy between tags
    can boost strength. But I''ve also whipped up some unique combinations at the
    cost of a little power. The <i>Bite</i> skill and the <i>Poison</i> tag is a
    powerful combination, creating a skill more powerful than the sum of its parts.'
