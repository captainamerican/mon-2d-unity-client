  Information: 'Lets me instantly travel between certain locations.


    Developed
    during the First Age in cooperation with Church clerics. A synthesis of the two
    magicks considered theretofore impossible. It was a triumph for necromancers,
    industry, and society at large.


    Unfortunately, rapid adoption led to the
    downfall of certain industries which exacerbated into a global conflict that
    ended the age and, soon thereafter, rendered the necromancers extinct.'
