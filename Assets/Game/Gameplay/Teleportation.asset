  Information: 'Lets me instantly travel between certain locations.


    Developed
    during the First Age in cooperation with Church clerics. A synthesis of the two
    magicks considered theretofore impossible. It was a triumph for necromancer relations,
    industry, and society at large.


    Widespread adoption severely damaged industries
    such as shipping. Peasant riots led to political upheaval which exacerbated into
    a global conflict. The First Age ended in decades of war, only ending with the
    Second Age Inquisitions that drove my kind extinct.


    No matter the ecosystem,
    rapid change is more toxin than panacea.'
