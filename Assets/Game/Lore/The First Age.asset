  Text: "The first age of peace. The last age of balance. \n\nNecromancers had made
    inroads with local populations on the mainland. The field workers had come to
    understand the work my people performed. To say they valued that work would go
    too far. The peasants rarely sought out a necromancer, but they did not complain
    when one came to town in search of death gone missing.\n\nThe Church also tolerated
    necromancers. They seemingly learned their lesson during events before the First
    Age. I only heard bits as a child. What probably was stories to scare children--necromancer
    children, at that. But suffice to say, something reminded the Church that the
    gods were not... solved problems.\n\nThe peace lasted more than four hundred
    years. Until there were even necromancer clerics, if you can believe it. Balance
    was at an all-time high until the unintended-but-disastrous repercussions brought
    about by the invention of teleportation."
